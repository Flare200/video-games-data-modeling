## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Should include python packages: 'numpy', 'pandas', 'matplotlib', 'sklearn', and 'seaborn'.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
The notebook comes with a function to install the functions for you, but you can install the libraries manually if you wish.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Video Games Sales up to 2019 to better understand:

1. Do games with higher critic scores tend to have higher user scores as well?
2. Could we predict a game's user score based on its critic score?
3. What's the average global sales for each game genre, ESRB rating, and platform?
4. How has the trend in global sales changed over the years?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available, `videogames.ipynb`, to showcase the work related to the above questions.  Question 1 is ineferential, question 2 is predictive, and questions 3 and 4 are exploratory.  Markdown cells were used when trying to explain the findings and thought process of the analysis. Comments were also used throughout the code to make it easier to follow.

There is also `vgsales-12-4-2019.csv` which is the dataset used in the notebook.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).
